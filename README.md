This repository contains my **Nix configurations**, currently focused on **NixOS server setup**, with plans to extend support for my **personal NixOS system** and **macOS (via nix-darwin)** in the future.

It is structured around [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and integrates several tools for system management, deployments, and secrets handling.
